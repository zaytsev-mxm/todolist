# ToDo App

Here we will try to create back-end for a ToDo application, where
we will be able to:

- register new users
- log in those users
- create ToDo lists
- edit those ToDo lists (add items, edit items, mark as done, etc.)

## Basic setup

Everything is as simple as:
```sh
# Create the .env file (amend its content if needed)
cp .env.sample .env

# Run the app
docker compose up
```
ðŸ˜ƒ Enjoy!

### How to run via IntelliJ IDEA

If you are using IntelliJ IDEA, you can run the app by pressing the green play button in your IDE.
For a detailed guide, please see [this](./docs/LAUNCHING_WITH_INTELLIJ_IDEA.md) document.

## Git Hooks

Please set up the Git hooks before you commit or push anything.

To do so, run this script [./tools/git/setup-hooks.sh](./tools/git/setup-hooks.sh)

## Testing the API
You can easily test the API using Postman. To do that, just:
- Install [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
- Import the request collection that you can find [here](./tools/postman/ToDo%20List.postman_collection.json), and also use the environment setup from this [file](./tools/postman/ToDoEr%20Local.postman_environment.json).

## Publishing new Docker image versions cheatsheet

New versions of the Docker images you build should be controlled via the `DOCKER_IMAGE_VERSION` environment variable.
Make sure you have it set before you build the image. Refer to [.env.sample](.env.sample) for more details.
```sh
# Build the image
sh tools/docker/build.sh

# Tag the built image
sh tools/docker/tag.sh

# Push the image
sh tools/docker/push.sh
```
